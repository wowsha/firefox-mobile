    TODO:
        The feature is highly dynamic, and we are temporarily adding the strings as non-translatable.
        Once the string definitions settle with UX, we should:
         1. Adjust the string keys and usages to match requirements
         2. Remove the "translatable=false"
         3. Submit a patch in phabricator (GitHub does not allow L10N reviewers)
